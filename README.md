# HLS-and-ATS-Heuristic-from-Avci-Topaloglu-2016-Paper

The following Excel Files are the Input Files:-
  \t Network Distance Matrix.xlsx \n
  Node Specifications.xlsx
  Vehicle Type Specifications.xlsx

The following Python Files contain the Individual Algorithms:-
  ATS_Algorithm.py
  ATS_Flowchart.py
  ATS_Text.py
  HLS_Algorithm.py
  HLS_Flowchart.py
  HLS_Text.py
  
All these Excel and Python Files need to be present in the same Folder along with the MainPythonFile.py
Run the MainPythonFile.py and get the results

 The paper AVCI Topaloglu 2016 has mentioned slightly different processes in its Algorithm, Flowchart and Text.
 The HLS Python Files are accordingly written implementing these minute differences.
 The ATS files are developed by removing the Tabu List from each of its corresponding HLS files.
